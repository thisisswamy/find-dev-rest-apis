Sure, here's an example README file you could use for your Spring Boot web services application with MongoDB, Docker, Amazon CloudFront, and EC2:

# Spring Boot Web Services Application with MongoDB, Docker, Amazon CloudFront, and EC2

## Description

This is a RESTful web services application built using Spring Boot and MongoDB. It uses Docker for containerization and is deployed on Amazon Web Services (AWS) Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) instance with CloudFront for content delivery.

## Prerequisites

To run this application, you will need:

- Java Development Kit (JDK) version 8 or higher
- MongoDB installed and running on default port (27017)
- Docker installed on your local machine
- AWS account with EC2 and CloudFront setup
- Amazon Web Services Command Line Interface (AWS CLI) installed and configured on your local machine

Usage
Once the application is running, you can access the RESTful endpoints by sending HTTP requests to the server on the specified port (8080 in this example).
